<p align="center">It's a small project coded by me. The MVP is just tracking the route of a user while he is moving. Once tracking is done, the route is then displayed on the home screen and user can view that saved track whenver he wants that will show him the map he have been moving through.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A simple location tracker.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you need to have nodejs installed. Please refer to [nodejs official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install it.

### Installing

To run this project locally on your machine you need to run following commands in your command line or terminal

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/ArifSanaullah/React-Native
```

then change current working directory by follwing command

```
cd React-Native
```

in that directory run to install all the dependencies

```
npm install
```

if you are not using npm as package manager then you'll have to install the dependencies with your installed package manager.

once installed, You will have to run the start script by executing the command

```
npm start
```

Once command executed successfully a new browser tab will open in your default browser with a QR code at the bottom left corner.

From now on you've got 3 options to run the application.

1. Running on android emulator
2. Running on iOS simulator
3. Running on your physical android/iOS device

I'm using the last one as it is easier to setup.
On your physical device you have to install expo application. You can download expo app from google playstore(android) or app store(ios).

After app's installation done. Open up the app tap on the top most option in tha app(Scan QR code) and scan the QR code displayed in your browser's tab.

After scanning the code app bundle will automatically start to build up and in a few seconds application will be on your mobile phone.
